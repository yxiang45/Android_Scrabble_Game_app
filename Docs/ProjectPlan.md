## 1 Introduction

This project is to develop an Android app called "Word Game". This game has some similarities to Scrabble but it is simpler and faster.

## 2 Process Description

### 2.1 Analyzing requirements and initializing the software design
- **Description:** In this stage, all team members will get together to analyze the requirements from the customer and create initial design of the software, leading by the program manager and technical lead. Each team member will sign the responsibility in this phase. The program manager should get all resources and arrange them.
- **Entrance criteria:** Requirements and all necessary information from the customer are gathered.
- **Exit criteria:** Class diagram is created to realize all functional requirements. 

### 2.2 Planning and Designing
- **Description:** In this stage, the team will create the project plan, test plan to define project scope, resources, strategies, test cases; and create design-related documents including necessary design diagrams/architecture, UI mock-ups, etc. 
- **Entrance criteria:** Requirements Analysis & Initial Design is completed.
- **Exit criteria:** The following documents are created: 
    * Project plan.
    * Test plan.
    * Use-case model and Supplementary requirements document.
    * Design document.

### 2.3 Implementing the software application
- **Description:** In this stage, the developer will develop the software application according to the design.
- **Entrance criteria:** Design documents are completed.
- **Exit criteria:** Application is implemented and User Manual are created.

### 2.4 Testing
- **Description:** In this stage, the tester is going to execute the test cases to ensure the application meets requirements. The tester should work with developers to fix the issues observed in the testing.
- **Entrance criteria:** Application is implemented.
- **Exit criteria:** All test cases are executed and testing results are as expected. No severe defects exists.

### 2.5 Releasing
- **Description:** In this stage, the project manager and technical lead are going to release the completed software and sign all documents with the customer.
- **Entrance criteria:** The software application passed all requirements and tests.
- **Exit criteria:** Release of the software, and complete all documentation with customers.

### 2.6 Maintenance
- **Description:** In this stage, the team is going to collect all customer feedback and failures reports. The report is created by the analysis of failures from customers. According to the report, the patch will be updated to the software. By analysis of the feedback from customers, the team will optimize update the software. 
- **Entrance criteria:** Feedback and failure report from customers. 
- **Exit criteria:** Updated version of the software released.
